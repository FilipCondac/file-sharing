# MERN Stack file sharing website

## Description

This project was the application which I developed in my thesis. The focus was improving UX within a file-sharing system. The system allows users
to join groups with other users, share files via word-phrase, QR Code and Links. Straight forward and easy to use.

The project was built using MERN alongside with Typescript. The authorization was handled using Firebase Auth.
